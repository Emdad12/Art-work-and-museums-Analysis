## SQL Queries
The SQL queries used in the analysis can be found in the [SQL Queries](SQL Queries) folder.

### Example Queries:
- **1. Fetch all the paintings which are not displayed on any museums?**:
  ```sql
  SELECT artist.full_name, COUNT(*) AS num_paintings
  FROM works
  JOIN artist ON works.artist_id = artist.artist_id
  GROUP BY artist.full_name
  ORDER BY num_paintings DESC
  LIMIT 5;
  ```
 Output:There are 5587 painting which are not displayed any museums 
- **2. Are there museums without any paintings?**:
  ```sql
  SELECT m.name, m.city
  FROM museum m
  WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM works w WHERE w.museum_id = m.museum_id);
  ```
 Output: Yes,there are 16 musuems without painting  
- **3. How many paintings have an asking price of more than their regular price?**  
```sql

```
Output:There are no painting have an asking price of more than their regular price 
- **4. Identify the paintings whose asking price is less than 50% of its regular price** 
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM works w
JOIN product_size ps
ON w.work_id = ps.work_id

## Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench
- GitHub for version control
- SQL for database querying and analysis

## How to Use
Clone the repository and use the SQL queries in any MySQL-compatible database system. You can adjust the queries to explore the data further or apply them to similar datasets.

## Future Work
- Incorporating machine learning for price prediction based on painting attributes.
- Further analysis of painting styles across different time periods.
